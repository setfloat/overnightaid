##What's the name of your project?
Overnight Aid.

##What problem does it solve?
It helps supply individuals with a weeks worth of clothes, toiletries, food, and other items.

##Who has this problem?
Our goal is to offer a service for people who face immediate adversity due to trying circumstances.  Whether their house has burned down, flooded, or they have a situation where they need to leave an unsafe home on a short notice.  Basic supplies are often needed in these situations and we want to provide them quickly.

##How does your project solve this problem?
We solve it by shipping basic supplies to our customers and as well as give them a choice on other products they may need to meet the basic needs of their family.

##What was the most valuable piece of User feedback you received?
We received some great constructive feedback from our user testing session.  We implemented a cursor change when our mouse hovered our buttons.

We changed the login/register button to be a logout button when the user is logged in.  This also provided the functionality of the user being able to log themselves out.

We had a suggestion to update the wording on our options selections, to make sure that the user knew they were receiving supplies for their pets, not actual pets. We took this a step further and added in a description about those items.

##What was the biggest technical challenge you had to overcome?
Biggest challenge was figuring out where exactly responsibilities should lie in components and how to consistently provide each component with the needed information.

##What lessons did your team learn as a result of your collaboration?
N: Have a good communication system.


P: Before coding we should have done been more focused on planning exact specifics of the structure, what the display should look like for each view, and what functionalities each action and event was expected to perform/where its results were stored.  This engendered communication struggles as we weren't explicit in what we wanted to build and on the same page about how it was going to look and work.
